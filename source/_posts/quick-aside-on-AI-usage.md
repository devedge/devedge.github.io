It seems that with the ubiquity of AI and its potential to disrupt so many fields, just about every blog has a take on its future. However, this is not what this post will be about. 

Rather, I'd like this to be more of a general disclaimer that, to date, in any of the work I do in the public/open source domain, I don't use AI to:

- Write any blog posts
- Generate or create any code
- Research any topics (including search engine summaries)

This isn't for ideological issues, but moreso that I genuinely enjoy the essence of the work I do. Using AI to replace myself in the loop feels like using an exoskeleton to lift weights, or an e-bike to cycle. I have also felt the frustration of becoming deeply engrossed in some technical article, only to eventually realize it isn't saying anything meaningful and was AI-generated (or heavily assisted).

If at any point I change this approach, I'll be sure to clearly annotate it, either in my posts or in my code.
